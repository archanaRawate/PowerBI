Finding:-
I have created a performance dashboard to analyze business performance over specific time periods, 
segmented by division, branch, hour, and executive. This allows us to compare the company's expected 
output with the actual results. **The company aimed for 80% resource utilization, 
but using Business Intelligence (BI), I found that the actual utilization was 84%.*** 
**This indicates that the company not only met but exceeded its desired results.***

Work:-
The file contains 3 Dataset namely Hour(January, February and March), Budgets and forcasts and People and task.
I have craeted adition Calender table for year wise data. In  calender table above columns has craeted with below given formulas:-
Date = CALENDAR( MIN(Hours[Date]), MAX(Hours[Date]) )
IsWorkDay = IF([WeekdayNum]<=5 ,1, 0)
Month = FORMAT([Date],"MMMM")
MonthNum = MONTH([Date])
Weekday = FORMAT([Date],"dddd")
WeekdayNum = WEEKDAY([Date],2)
WeekNum = WEEKNUM([Date])
WorkHours = IF([IsWorkDay],8,0)
Year = YEAR([Date])


Cleaned the data  specialy recomend if your data is not big clean data before uploading it to power BI.
After claening  changed datatype in desired formate.
